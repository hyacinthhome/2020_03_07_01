，但由于我校地处上海这座国际都市型的城市，学生对学习口语有较高的愿望和热情。我校各级领导根据教育部的步骤，着力推进教育创新，重视提高学生的英语综合应用能力和交际能力 , 并在政策上、资金上给予支持。在教务处的指导下，在外语学院党总支和院长的直接领导下，由学术委员会主任张群教授挂帅，大学英语部副主任冯涟漪具体负责 , 我们以大学英语口语精品课程建设作为突破口之一 ,

月高教部关于大学英语教学改革文件提出之前就已成立；课程顺应了教改对提高学生听说能力的要求。大学英语口语精品课程经过五年的建设，获得了可贵的提高中国大学生口语的教学和测试评估的经验。然我们尚须进一步建立完善大学英语口语教学文件（如教学大纲、教学目标、课程描述、教学安排、教学进度、考核方式等），进一步确立 以 现代化英语教学理论为指导、以教学实验与研究为核心、对英语口语和教学作全方位探索的精品课建设原则和模式。我们尚须 进一步以口语为突破口，逐步改变大学英语忽视语言交际能力培养的历史状态，切实将学生的学习兴趣引至语言应用和交际能力的方向，借助口语精品课程建设内容，加强对大学生的人文教育，提高大学生的文化素质，并增强他们对祖国文化 ﹑ 历史和优秀民族传统的理解和继承能力。我们尚须 进一步紧随高教部的指示精神，以第二语言习得理论为指导，在加强学生自主学习和使用现代教育手段方面作更深入细致的研究，将精品口语课程中关键元素作分析，细化，提炼，强化和推广，更有效地渗透并融合进阅读，写作，听力，翻译等其他方面的教学 , 加强与国内外高校和学术机构的联系 , 以论文和专著形式 总结以大学英语口语精品课程建设为龙头 <strong>促进大学英语教学模式深化改革 </strong>的成果， <strong>立志成为 国家级精品课程 </strong>。 </p>\r\n                <p align=\"left\">总<span class=\"MsoNormal style4\">之，口语精品课程建设既任重道远，又需以只争朝夕的精神来对待。我们课程组全体教师誓将 <strong>齐心协力，精诚合作，不辞辛苦，不断创新 </strong>，力求以口语精品课程建设为基点，为大学公共英语课程的教学改革作更大的贡献，实现教育部高教司关于“大学英语课程教学要求（试行）的通知”提出的目标。　 </span> </p></td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n            <tr>\r\n              <td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n            </tr>\r\n

In the late 1700's people didn't know the exact time unless they were near a clock. Those delightful clocks in the squares of European towns were built for the public. After all, most citizens simply couldn't afford a personal time piece. Well into the 1800's in Europe and United States, the main purpose of a watch, which by the way was off on a gold chain, was to show others how wealthy you were. The word “wrist watch” didn't even enter the English language until nearly 1900. By then the rapid pace of the industrialization in the United States meant that measuring time hand become essential. How could the factory worker get to work on time unless he or she knew exactly what time it was? Since the efficiency was now measured by how fast the job was done, everyone was interested in time. And since industrialization made possible the manufacture of large quantities of goods, watches became fairly inexpensive. Furthermore, electric lights kept factories going around the clock.

To begin to answer this question, I need to back track a little bit and talk about classical ballet. By the late 1800's, ballet had lost a lot of its popularity. Most of the ballet dancers who performed using the rigid techniques that had been passed down through the centuries. Audiences and dancers in the United States were eager for their own contemporary dance form and so around 1900 dancers created one. So how was this modern dance so different from classical ballet? Most notably, it wasn't carefully choreographed. Instead the dance depended on the improvisation and free personal expression of the dancers. Music and theory were of little importance to the modern dance. And lightness of movement wasn't important, either. In fact modern dancers made no attempt at all to conceal the effort involved in the dance step. But even if these improvisations appeal to audiences, many dance critics were less enthusiastic about the performances. They questioned the artistic integrity of dancers who were not professionally trained and the artistic value of works that had no formal structure. Loi Fore, after performing fire dance, was described as doing little more than turning around and around like an eggbeater. Yet the free personal expression of the pioneer dancers is the basis of the controlled freedom of modern dance today. \")])])]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('tr',[_c('td',{attrs:{\"valign\":\"top\"}},[_c('p',[_vm._v(\"American Civilization \"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n        In the late 1400's, when Christopher Columbus returned to Spain from the western hemisphere, he brought with him a sample of what the native Americans called maize, or as we call it more often today, corn.

After about a thousand years, they had developed a highly productive strands of corn which later became the basis for the great pre-Columbian civilizations. Figuratively speaking, both the cities of the Incas and the temples of the Mayas were built on corn. Domesticated corn and the people who cultivated it developed together. Without humans to care for it, domesticated corn could not survive. The kernels are crowded together beneath the strong protected husk and silk.

The great auk, as you can see, was a rather large bird, and it couldn't fly either. However, evidence suggests that the auk was an excellent swimmer and diver. Unfortunately, those abilities didn't protect it from being easy prey for hungry sailors who years ago sailed the very cold and often icy waters of Greenland, Iceland and Scotland. In fact, records indicate that the auk was rather tasty and that its eggs—Excuse me…that its eggs and feathers were useful as well. Still, it isn't clear what other factors led to the big bird's demise around 1844, the last time anyone reported seeing one.
